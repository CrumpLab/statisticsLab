Thanks to Open Stats Labs (Dr. Kevin P. McIntyre) for their fantastic work. 6.1 Does Music Convey Social Information to Infants? This lab activity uses the open data from Experiment 1 of Mehr, Song, and Spelke (2016) to teach one-sample and paired samplest -tests. Results of the activity provided below should exactly reproduce the results described in the paper. 6.1.1 STUDY DESCRIPTION Parents often sing to their children and, even as infants, children listen to and look at their parents while they are singing.Research by Mehr, Song, and Spelke (2016) sought to explore the psychological function that music has for parents and infants, by examining the hypothesis that particular melodies convey important social information to infants.Specifically, melodies convey information about social affiliation. The authors argue that melodies are shared within social groups. Whereas children growing up in one culture may be exposed to certain songs as infants (e.g., “Rock-a-bye Baby”), children growing up in other cultures (or even other groups within a culture) may be exposed to different songs.Thus, when a novel person (someone who the infant has never seen before) sings a familiar song, it may signal to the infant that this new person is a member of their social group. To test this hypothesis, the researchers recruited 32 infants and their parents to complete an experiment.During their first visit to the lab, the parents were taught a new lullaby (one that neither they nor their infants had heard before).The experimenters asked the parents to sing the new lullaby to their child every day for the next 1-2 weeks. Following this 1-2 week exposure period, the parents and their infant returned to the lab to complete the experimental portion of the study.Infants were first shown a screen with side-by-side videos of two unfamiliar people, each of whom were silently smiling and looking at the infant.The researchers recorded the looking behavior (or gaze) of the infants during this ‘baseline’ phase. Next, one by one, the two unfamiliar people on the screen sang either the lullaby that the parents learned or a different lullaby (that had the same lyrics and rhythm, but a different melody).Finally, the infants saw the same silent video used at baseline, and the researchers again recorded the looking behavior of the infants during this ‘test’ phase.For more details on the experiment’s methods, please refer to Mehr et al.

Link to .pdf of article Data in .csv format Data in SPSS format 6.4 R 6.4.1 Loading the data The first thing to do is download the .csv formatted data file, using the link above, or just click here. It turns out there are lots of ways to load .csv files into R. Load the data.table library. Then use the fread function and supply the web address to the file. Just like this. No downloading required. library(data.table) all_data &lt;- fread(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/master/data/MehrSongSpelke2016.csv&quot;) Or, if you downloaded the .csv file. Then you can use fread, but you need to point it to the correct file location. The file location in this next example will not work for you, because the file is on my computer. library(data.table) all_data &lt;- fread(&quot;Data/MehrSongSpelke2016.csv&quot;) 6.4.2 Inspect the data frame When you have loaded data it’s always a good idea to check out what it looks like. You can look at all of the data in the environment tab on the top right hand corner. The data should be in a variable called all_data. Clicking on all_data will load it into a viewer, and you can scroll around. This can be helpful to see things. But, there is so much data, can be hard to know what you are looking for. 6.4.2.1 summarytools The summarytools packages give a quick way to summarize all of the data in a data frame. Here’s how. When you run this code you will see the summary in the viewer on the bottom right hand side. There’s a little browser button (arrow on top of little window) that you can click to expand and see the whole thing in a browser. library(summarytools) view(dfSummary(all_data)) 6.4.3 Get the data for Experiment one The data contains all of the measurements from all five experiments in the paper. By searching through the all_data dataframe, you should look for the variables that code for each experiment. For example, the third column is called exp1, which stands for experiment 1. Notice that it contains a series of 1s. If you keep scrolling down, the 1s stop. These 1s identify the rows associated with the data for Experiment 1. We only want to analyse that data. So, we need to filter our data, and put only those rows into a new variable. We do this with the dplyr library, using the filter function. library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:data.table&#39;: ## ## between, first, last ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union experiment_one &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(exp1==1) ## Warning: package &#39;bindrcpp&#39; was built under R version 3.4.4 Now if you look at the new variable experiment_one, there are only 32 rows of data. Much less than before. Now we have the data from experiment 1. 6.4.4 Baseline phase: Conduct a one sample t-test You first want to show that infants’ looking behavior did not differ from chance during the baseline trial. The baseline trial was 16 seconds long. During the baseline, infants watched a video of two unfamilar people, one of the left and one on the right. There was no sound during the basline. Both of the actors in the video smiled directly at the infant. The important question was to determine whether the infant looked more or less to either person. If they showed no preference, the infant should look at both people about 50% of the time. How could we determine whether the infant looked at both people about 50% of the time? The experiment_one dataframe has a column called Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer. All of these values show how the proportion of time that the infant looked to the person who would later sing the familiar song to them. If the average of these proportion is .5 across the infants, then we would have some evidence that the infants were not biased at the beginning of the experiment. However, if the infants on average had a bias toward the singer, then the average proportion of the looking time should be different than .5. Using a one-sample t-test, we can test the hypothesis that our sample mean for the Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer was not different from .5. To do this in R, we just need to isolate the column of data called Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer. We will do this using the $ operator. The $ operator is placed after any data frame variable, and allows you to select a column of the data. The next bit of code will select the column of data we want, and put it into a new variable called Baseline. Note, if you type exp1$ then Rstudio should automatically bring up all the columns you can choose from. baseline &lt;- experiment_one$Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer 6.4.4.1 Look at the numbers Ok, we could just do the t-test right away, it’s really easy, only one line of code. But, we haven’t even looked at the numbers yet. Let’s at least do that. First, we’ll just use plot. It will show every data point for each infant as a dot. plot(baseline) That’s helpful, we see that the dots are all over the place. Let’s do a histrogram, so we can get a better sense of the frequency of different proportions. hist(baseline) 6.4.4.2 Look at the descriptives Let’s get the mean and standard deviation of the sample mean(baseline) ## [1] 0.5210967 sd(baseline) ## [1] 0.1769651 Ok, so just looking at the mean, we see the proportion is close to .5 (it’s .521). And, we see there is a healthy amount of variance (the dots were all over the place), as the standard deviation was about .176. Now, before we run the t-test, what do you think is going to happen? We are going to get a t-value, and an associated p-value. If you can make a guess at what those numbers would be right now in your head, and those end up being pretty close to the ones we will see in a moment, then you should pat yourself on the back. You have learned how to have intuitions about the data. As I am writing this I will tell you that 1) I can’t remember what the t and p was from the paper, and I haven’t done the test yet, so I don’t know the answer. So, I am allowed to guess what the answer will be. Here are my guesses t(31) = 0.2, p = .95. The numbers in the brackets are degrees of freedom, which we know are 31 (df= n-1 = 32-1= 31). More important than the specific numbers I am guessing (which will probably be wrong), I am guessing that the p-value will be pretty large, it will not be less than .05, which the author’s set as their alpha rate. So, I am guessing we will not reject the hypothesis that .52 is different from .5. Let’s do the t-test and see what happens. 6.4.4.3 Conduct t.test t.test(baseline, mu=.5) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: baseline ## t = 0.67438, df = 31, p-value = 0.5051 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0.5 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4572940 0.5848994 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 0.5210967 So, there we have it. We did a one-sample t-test. Here’s how you would report it, t(31) = .67, p = .505. Or, we might say something like: During the basline condition, the mean proportion looking time toward the singer was .52, and was not significantly different from .5, according to a one-sample test, t(31) = .67, p = .505. You should take the time to check this result, and see if it is the same one that was reported in the paper. 6.4.5 Test phase Remember how the experiment went. Infants watched silent video recordings of two women (Baseline). Then each person sung a song, one was familiar to the infant (their parents sung the song to them many times), and one was unfamiliar (singing phase). After the singing phase, the infants watched the silent video of the two singers argain (test phase). The critical question was whether the infants would look more to the person who sung the familiar song compared to the person who sun the unfamiliar song. If the infants did this, they should look more than 50% of the time to the singer who sang the familiar song. We have the data, we can do another one sample t-test to find out. We can re-use all the code we already wrote to do this. I’ll put it all in one place. If we run all of this code, we will see all of the things we want to see. We only need to make two changes. We will change experiment_one$Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer to experiment_one$Test_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer, because that column has the test phase data. And, instead of putting the data into the variable baseline. We will make a new variable called test_phase to store the data. test_phase &lt;- experiment_one$Test_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer plot(test_phase) hist(test_phase) mean(test_phase) ## [1] 0.5934913 sd(test_phase) ## [1] 0.1786884 t.test(test_phase, mu = .5) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: test_phase ## t = 2.9597, df = 31, p-value = 0.005856 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0.5 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.5290672 0.6579153 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 0.5934913 Alright. What did we find? You should take a stab at writing down what we found. You can use the same kind of language that I used from the first one sample-test. You should state the mean proportion, the t-value, the dfs, and the p-value. You should be able to answer the question, did the infants look longer at the singer who sang the familiar song? And, did they look longer than would be consist with chance at 50%. 6.4.6 Paired-samples t-test The paired samples t-test is easy to do. We’ve already made two variables called baseline, and test_phase. These contain each of the infants looking time proportions to the singer for both parts of the experiment. We can see if the difference between them was likely or unlikely due to chance by running a paired samples t-test. We do it like this in one line: t.test(baseline, test_phase, paired=TRUE, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: baseline and test_phase ## t = -2.4164, df = 31, p-value = 0.02175 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.13349698 -0.01129217 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -0.07239458 I’l leave it to you to interpret these values, and to see if they are the same as the ones in the paper. Based on these values what do you conclude? Is there a difference between the mean proportion looking times for the baseline and testing phase? 6.4.6.1 Relationship between one-sample and paired sample t-test We’ve discussed in the textbook that the one-sample and paired sample t-test are related, they can be the same test. The one-sample test whether a sample mean is different from some particular mean. The paired sample t-test, is to determine whether one sample mean is different from another sample mean. If you take the scores for each variable in a paired samples t-test, and subtract them from one another, then you have one list of difference scores. Then, you could use a one sample t-test to test whether these difference scores are different from 0. It turns out you get the same answer from a paired sample t-test testing the difference between two sample means, and the one sample t-test testing whether the mean difference of the difference scores between the samples are different from 0. We can show this in r easily like this: t.test(baseline, test_phase, paired=TRUE, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: baseline and test_phase ## t = -2.4164, df = 31, p-value = 0.02175 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.13349698 -0.01129217 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -0.07239458 difference_scores&lt;-baseline-test_phase t.test(difference_scores, mu=0) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: difference_scores ## t = -2.4164, df = 31, p-value = 0.02175 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.13349698 -0.01129217 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## -0.07239458 6.4.7 Data-simulation We can do a little bit of data simulation to get a better feel for this kind of data. For example, we saw that the dots in our plots were quite variable. We might wonder about what chance can do in the current experiment. One way to do this is to estimate the standard deviation of the looking time proportions. Perhaps the best way to do that would be to an average of the standard deviation in the baseline and test_phase conditions. Then, we could simulate 32 scores from a normal distribution with mean = .5, and standard deviation equalling our mean standard deviation. We could calculate the mean of our simulated sample. And, we could do this many times, say 1000 times. Then, we could look at a histogram of our means. This will show the range of sample means we would expect just by chance. This is another way to tell whether the observed difference in this experiment in the testing phase was close or not close from being produced by chance. Take a look at the histogram. What do you think? sample_sd &lt;- (sd(baseline)+sd(test_phase))/2 simulated_means &lt;- length(1000) for(i in 1:1000){ simulated_means[i] &lt;- mean(rnorm(32,.5, sample_sd)) } hist(simulated_means) #### Simulating the mean differences We can do the simulation slightly differently to give us a different look at chance. Above we simulated the sample means from a normal distibrution centered on .5. The experimental question of interest was whether the mean difference between the baseline and test_phase condition was different. So, we should do a simulation of the difference scores. First, we estimate the standard deviation of the difference scores, and then run the simulation with a normal distribution centered on 0 (an expected mean difference of 0). This shows roughly how often we might expect mean differences of various sizes to occur. One major limitation is that we likely had only a rough estimate of the true standard deviation of these mean differences, after all there were only 32 of them, so we should take this with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, the pattern in the simulation fits well with the observations in that we already made from the data. sample_sd &lt;- sd(baseline-test_phase) simulated_mean_difference &lt;- length(1000) for(i in 1:1000){ simulated_mean_difference[i] &lt;- mean(rnorm(32,0, sample_sd)) } hist(simulated_mean_difference) 6.5 Excel How to do it in Excel 6.6 SPSS How to do it in SPSS 6.7 Matlab How to do it in Matlab "]
